    <h1> How To Play</h1>
    <p> Hello! Welcome to Astro Blasters. In this game, the class will be set up into teams of three randomly. Each team will have 2 hearts, and their goal is to be the last one standing.<br><br>
        Every round, a new question appears, and a person dedicated to hitting a buzzer attempts to buzz in the fastest. The fastest team may attempt to answer the question. if they are correct, their attack meter charges by one.<br.<br>  
        After two successful questions are answered in a row, the team with the full charge meter may choose which team to attack. However, if a question is answered incorrectly, the charge meter resets to zero.
